# HandySpeaks

HandySpeaks is an electromechanical glove designed to recognize and interpret American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. It integrates flex sensors, an MPU6050 sensor, an SD card module, and a speaker to facilitate communication for individuals with speech and hearing impairments. The glove captures hand movements, processes them using an Arduino Mega microcontroller, and outputs corresponding spoken words to aid communication.

## Installation

1. Connect the flex sensors and MPU6050 sensor to the Arduino Mega microcontroller according to the provided schematic.
2. Insert the SD card containing word audio files into the SD card module.
3. Power on the Arduino Mega and ensure all components are properly initialized.
4. Upload the project code to the Arduino Mega using the Arduino IDE or similar software.
5. Calibrate the sensors as per the provided guidelines.
6. Test the glove by performing ASL gestures and verifying the spoken word output.

## Usage

- Wear the glove on the right hand and ensure all components are powered on.
- Perform ASL gestures by bending fingers and moving the hand.
- The glove will interpret the gestures and output corresponding spoken words through the speaker.
- Adjust sensitivity and calibration settings as needed for optimal performance.
